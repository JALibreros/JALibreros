### Hi there, I'm Jesus Libreros 👋
**Principal Solutions Architect | Technical Delivery Lead | GenAI Strategy**

I operate at the intersection of **Business Strategy** and **Advanced Engineering**. I don't just design systems; I own the full lifecycle—from **Pre-Sales** and value proposition to **Agile Delivery** and final deployment. I specialize in modernizing legacy ecosystems (SharePoint) into Multi-Cloud & Generative AI powerhouses.

🚀 **The 360° Value Proposition:**

* 💼 **Strategic Leadership & Pre-Sales:**
    * Leading technical proposals (RFPs) and aligning IT roadmap with business revenue goals.
    * Translating complex AI/Cloud concepts for C-Level stakeholders to drive adoption.
    * Managing cross-functional teams and budgets for high-impact migrations.

* 🏗️ **Cloud & AI Architecture:**
    * **Generative AI:** Designing **RAG** patterns and **Agents** on AWS Bedrock & Vertex AI.
    * **Multi-Cloud:** Architecting secure environments on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
    * **Modernization:** Transforming SharePoint On-Premises monoliths into agile Cloud microservices.

* 📅 **Technical Program Management:**
    * Orchestrating end-to-end delivery using Agile/Scrum methodologies.
    * Risk management and resource allocation for complex migration projects.

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
* **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3), Google Cloud (Functions, BigQuery), Microsoft 365.
* **Dev & AI:** Python, LangChain, PowerShell (PnP), React.js.
* **Ops:** GitHub Actions, Terraform, CI/CD.

🌱 **Current Focus:**
