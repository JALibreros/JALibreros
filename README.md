## Professional Summary

I specialize in the full lifecycle ownership of complex systems—from **Pre-Sales** and value proposition definition to **Agile Delivery** and final deployment. My focus is on orchestrating enterprise ecosystems—spanning **SharePoint, Power Platform, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure**—to build scalable Multi-Cloud architectures and Generative AI solutions that drive tangible business value.

## Strategic Pillars of Expertise

To drive innovation at an enterprise scale, I focus my work on three core pillars:

### 1. Cloud Modernization & Intelligent Automation
* **Legacy Transformation:** Expert in deconstructing on-premises monoliths and re-platforming them into cloud-native microservices on AWS, Azure & GCP.
* **Complex Migrations:** Specialization in inter-version migrations (SharePoint 2010/2013/2016 to Online) leveraging **ShareGate** and advanced **PowerShell** automation to ensure data integrity and compliance.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Replacing legacy logic with robust **Power Automate** flows and Logic Apps to streamline enterprise operations and reduce technical debt.

### 2. Generative AI & Copilot Strategy
* **Enterprise Copilots:** Extending **Microsoft Copilot** (M365 & Copilot Studio) to create custom conversational agents that securely integrate with internal business data.
* **RAG Architectures:** Building "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" systems on **AWS Bedrock** and **Vertex AI** that allow enterprises to query private documents naturally.
* **Data Intelligence:** Bridging the gap between unstructured data and strategic decision-making using **Power BI** for advanced analytics and visualization.

### 3. Technical Leadership & Delivery
* **Customer Obsession (Pre-Sales):** Leading RFPs, managing client expectations, and translating complex technical architectures into clear ROI for C-Level executives.
* **Agile Orchestration:** Managing cross-functional teams to deliver mission-critical migrations on time and within budget.
* **Operational Excellence:** Implementing CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to ensure reproducibility and scale.

## Technical Stack

* **Cloud & Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, Power Platform.
* **AI & Data:** Microsoft Copilot Studio, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, Power BI.
* **Development:** Python, TypeScript, PowerShell (PnP), React.js.
* **Migration Tools:** ShareGate, SPMT, Custom PowerShell Scripting.

## Current Focus & Growth Areas
* **Intelligent Process Automation:** Architecting end-to-end workflows that fuse **Power Automate** with **AI Agents** to autonomously execute complex business operations and eliminate manual bottlenecks.
* **Agentic Systems:** Moving beyond passive chatbots to building multi-agent ecosystems capable of reasoning and taking action across cloud services.
* **Cloud FinOps:** Optimizing cloud spend and resource allocation for large-scale data migrations.
* **Enterprise Security:** Implementing Zero Trust architectures and governance for Generative AI applications.
